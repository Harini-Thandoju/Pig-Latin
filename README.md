# Pig-Latin
This Project works as follows:
First of all get the input from the user and then splits the sentence into words.
and loops through words and converts into pig latin.
To convert the words into pig latin there are two rules:
1.If the word starts with vowel, it just adds "yay" at the last.
2.otherwise, moves the first consonant cluser to end , and adds "ay".
At last stick words back together to a single sentence and print the final sentence in Pig-Latin.
